About
-----
Just try me, I'm a set of configurations for Vim and Bash to make bash and vim better!
Once first used, you'll be able to see my confs in .codenv, everything bundled toghether.
I pair fair well with CoPIM, a project with similar concepts and code (by the same author), the only real way to see me working is trying me!
Autocompletion popup will go out automatically, so you don't press tab, tab will throw code snippets, you have also some templates, for bash perl and so (as this integrates bash-support.vim perl-support.vim c-support.vim and ViP among others).

Devel
-----
CodEnv devel comes with a predefined set of vim plugins to make development faster, this includes support for many languages and Autocompletion.
Try editing whatever and you'll see autocompletion working without using tab thanks to "acp" plugin, code snippets via snippetsEmu, better php work thanks to ViP, and much more by \*-support.vim.

Publish
-------
CodEnv publish comes with VimPress and Tumblr.vim, wich will allow you to publish to blogs.
It also includes VST and latexvba, to ease working with rst and latex.

Manage
------
VimTrac to control your tracs and timelog.vim is all I need for project management, is it your case? Then this is all you need!

Docs
-----
You'll have to take a look at ~/.codenv/vim/\*/Docs/\*
